ADAS Level-1 Simulation (Win32 – C)

A Level-1 Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) simulator built using C and the Win32 API, designed to demonstrate core vehicle safety and driver-assistance features through an interactive graphical interface.

This project simulates real-world ADAS behavior such as Forward Collision Warning, TPMS, door safety logic, lane change validation, and audible alerts, making it suitable for academic mini-projects, demonstrations, and learning Win32 GUI programming.

🚗 Project Overview

The ADAS Level-1 Simulation provides a dashboard-style interface where users can control vehicle parameters (speed, distance, tyre pressure, doors, indicators, etc.) and observe how ADAS features react in real time.

The focus is on: Safety logic, Driver awareness, Human–Machine Interface (HMI) behavior, Event-based warnings

✨ Features Implemented

Forward Collision Warning (FCW): Speed slider and front-distance slider. Adaptive FCW logic based on speed vs distance. Visual warnings on MID, High-priority audible alerts when collision risk is detected

Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS): Base tyre pressure reference Individual sliders for all four tyres Automatic detection of under-inflated tyres Warning indication on MID Medium-priority warning beep

Vehicle State Controls (Toggle buttons): Headlights ON/OFF Day / Night mode Hands-on steering detection Left & Right indicators Lane change request Door obstacle detection Each toggle updates the MID in real time.

Door Safety System Individual door open/close buttons Safety checks: Doors cannot open while vehicle is moving Doors blocked if obstacle is detected Clear warning messages displayed on MID Audible alerts for unsafe actions

Lane Change Assist Logic Lane change allowed only if indicator is active Warning shown if lane change is requested without indication Mimics real ADAS driver-intent validation

Custom MID (Multi-Information Display) Centralized display for: Speed Distance TPMS status Door states ADAS warnings Optimized size for clarity (not oversized) Clean and readable layout

Audible Warning System Different beep patterns for different priorities: 🔴 High priority: Collision warnings, unsafe actions 🟡 Medium priority: TPMS alerts 🔵 Low priority: Informational alerts Implemented using Win32 Beep / sound logic.
